So in Google AI Studio, clicking **“Switch to API Key for your app”** does **NOT** change your code. No files get rewritten. It’s purely changing how authentication works at runtime inside AI Studio.

When you’re in the “free / unlimited tokens” mode, AI Studio is basically handling the credentials for you behind the scenes. It’s like there’s an internal key/session that works only *inside* AI Studio, and it still enforces guardrails (like checking where requests are coming from) so you’re not using that unlimited mode outside of Studio (ex: localhost or a deployed site).

When you switch to **API key mode**, AI Studio stops using that internal “unlimited” setup and instead asks you to bring your own credentials. That’s why it pops a modal where you can **select a Google Cloud Project** (or create one right there), and then associate an API key with the app.

Later, if you click **Export / “Get code”**, *that* generated sample code will usually expect an API key via an environment variable (`API_KEY`). But that env-var wiring is part of the exported code path — not something the “Switch to API key” button edits in your repo.
